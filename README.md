# DSA-AI-ML-Project

## PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project involved the development of an end-to-end credit card fraud detection system that analyzes transaction patterns and predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. The system combines exploratory data analysis, machine learning modeling, and web deployment, resulting in a fully functional and publicly accessible application.

### Data Collection & Understanding: 

A real-world credit card transactions dataset was used, containing numerical features representing transaction behavior and a target variable indicating fraud (1) or non-fraud (0). Special attention was paid to the class imbalance, since fraudulent transactions occur far less frequently than legitimate ones.

### Data Preprocessing:

The dataset was cleaned and prepared for modeling by:

* Removing null and duplicate values
* Separating features and target labels
* Handling class imbalance
* Splitting the data into training and testing sets

This ensured the model learned meaningful patterns without bias.
